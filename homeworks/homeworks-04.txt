6. Write a bash script which will rotate logs. The idea is simple, in one directory you have a few logs - access.log, error.log and system.log, you need to create a script that on each of its runs will rename each of the logs to LOG.1 and then gzip the file(LOG is the name of the log that is beeing renamed). If there is already LOG.1.gz then the file should be renamed to LOG.2.gz and so on. You need to keep max of 12 copies of the logs.
7. Write a bash script that will output only the unique numbers in a file that is with the following format:
  word | number
